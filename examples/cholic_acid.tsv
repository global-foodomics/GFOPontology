Wild type (a/a) agouti mouse dams were randomized to one of three diets (control, mediterranean, western) two weeks prior to pairing with an agouti (Avy/a) sire. Diet exposure continued through pregnancy and lactation. All pups were weaned onto the control diet and then followed for metabolic phenotyping measures to 10 months of age. Comprehensive phenotyping (body composition, CLAMS, blood draw) was completed at 2, 4, and 8 months, with an OGTT at 8 months. Weekly weights were also recorded. The study examines whether prenatal dietary exposure to high fat diets (HFD) and bisphenol a (BPA, those groups will not be tested in this pilot) impacts metabolic programming in offspring as measured by hepatic steatosis, serum hormone levels, and epigenetic changes in hepatic lipid metabolism genes.	continuous/clustered_data/MSV000082731_specs_ms.mgf	MSV000082731	Mus musculus	1420	Metabolomics Workbench ST000670 - GNPS - Exposure to high fat diets and bisphenol	12	15	0.000410338733502158	0.8051520206203113	specs_ms.mgf	1

The Burkholderia cepacia complex is a group of closely related species with large genomes that infect immunocompromised individuals or those living with cystic fibrosis. Some of these species are found more frequently and cause more severe disease than others, yet metabolomic differences between these species have not been described. Furthermore, our understanding of how these species respond to antibiotics is limited. We investigated the metabolomics differences between 10 Burkholderia strains including: B. cenocepacia J2315, B. cenocepacia K56-2, B. cenocepacia C5424, B. multivorans CF-1, B. multivorans CF-2, B. multivorans ATCC 17616, B. dolosa AU0645, B. dolosa AU1058, B. ambifaria H14274, and B. thailandensis E264 in the presence and absence of the antibiotic trimethoprim. Using a combination of supervised and unsupervised metabolomics data visualization and analysis tools, we describe the overall differences between strains of the same species and between species. Specifically, we report for the first time the role of the pyomelanin pathway in bacterial metabolism of trimethoprim using B. cenocepacia J2315 khmgA and K56-2 jhmgA strains with variants in the hmgA gene (which is responsible for pyomelanin production). We also report differences in detection of known secondary metabolites such as fragin, ornibactin, and N-acylhomoserine lactones and their analogs in closely related strains. Furthermore, we highlight the potential for the discovery of new secondary metabolites in clinical strains of Burkholderia spp. The metabolomics differences described in this study highlight the personalized nature of closely related Burkholderia strains.	continuous/clustered_data/MSV000084945_specs_ms.mgf	MSV000084945	Burkholderia sp.

RERUN OF TH SAMPLES ONLY. Enteric neurons have long been implicated in various physiologies. Recent studies have shown that enteric neurons are affected by the microbiota. However, how certain populations of enteric neurons affect physiology, and methods to ask these questions have been evasive. In this study, we are employing activation DREADDs (designed-receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) to address the effect of activating subsets of enteric neurons on the host, specifically in the context of the microbiome and metabolome. Two subsets of neurons we are activating are TH (tyrosine-hydroxylase- rate limiting enzyme for catecholamine synthesis) and ChAT (Choline acetyl transferase- rate limiting enzyme for acetylcholine synthesis).

Fecal samples of C57BL/6 mice exposed to relevant levels of cadmium and arsenic over two weeks in the drinking water. Sample types include controls, arsenic and cadmium groups. The samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and data was recorded in a data dependent manner, on a Q-Exactive (Thermo scientific, Bremen, Germany). An EASY nLC-1000 liquid chromatography system (Thermo scientific, Odense, Denmark) was coupled to the mass spectrometer through a 2 cm C18 pre-column (300 um inner diameter and 1.9 um particle size) and a self-packed 15 cm (Pico Frit columns from New Objective with a 75 um inner diameter, packed with ( 1.9um C18 Dr Maisch Mat. No. r119.a). Metabolites were eluted with a mobile phase consisting of solvent A (0.1% formic acid) and B (80% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid). The concentration of solvent B was linearly increased from 2-10% over 3 min and from 10-95% solution B over 15min. Solvent B was maintained at 95% for 2 min. Full scans were acquired in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 70000, maximum injection time of 20 ms and a scan range of 80-1200 m/z using a Top 10 method with an isolation window of 1.6 Da and a dynamic exclusion time of 15 sec. For the MS/MS scans the resolution was adjusted to 17500 and maximum injection time of 60 ms.

Infections by Burkholderia cenocepacia lead to life-threatening disease in immunocompromised individuals, including those living with cystic fibrosis (CF). While genetic variation in various B. cenocepacia strains has been reported, it remains unclear how environmental conditions found in the CF lung influence the production of small molecules that may impact virulence of these strains. Here we compare metabolomic profiles of three clinical B. cenocepacia strains cultured in synthetic CF sputum media (SCFM2) and in a routine laboratory media (LB), in the presence and absence of the antibiotic trimethoprim. Using a mass spectrometry based untargeted metabolomics approach, we identify several compound classes which are differentially produced in SCFM2 compared to LB media, including siderophores, antimicrobials, quorum sensing signals, and various lipid families. Furthermore, we describe how metabolomic changes induced by the antibiotic trimethoprim vary in SCFM2 compared to LB. The differences described in this study provide insight into the diversity of secondary metabolites produced by B. cenocepacia strains under conditions representative of the nutritional conditions present in CF-associated lung environments. 	continuous/clustered_data/MSV000087793_specs_ms.mgf	MSV000087793	Burkholderia cenocepacia (NCBITaxon:95486)	321	GNPS-Burkholderia_trimethoprim_SCFM2vsLB	28	10	0.000410338733502158	0.6741072486764936	specs_ms.mgf	1

The solid phase extraction with wash was carried out to reduce impact of cell culture media which is highly detrimental for the ESI. The 30 mg sorbent Oasis HLB (Waters, Waltham, MA) SPE cartridges were used to achieve broad metabolite coverage. The cell samples were stored at -80?  and thawed at room temperature immediately prior to extraction. The thawed samples were then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1200 rpm and extracted.  For the SPE extraction, the Oasis HLB SPE cartridge was conditioned with 700µL of 100% HPLC grade methanol and equilibrated with 700µL of HPLC grade DI water. The cell supernatant (~350-400µL) was loaded into cartridge and allowed to slowly elute. The loaded SPE wells were then washed with 800µL of 5% methanol in water and the absorbed material was slowly eluted with 200 µL of 100% methanol. Vacuum up to ~ 20 psi was applied for the wells that did not elute within an hour. The collected eluent was stored at -20? until the HPLC-MS analysis. 	continuous/clustered_data/MSV000082045_specs_ms.mgf	MSV000082045	Homo sapiens (NCBITaxon:9606)	557840	GNPS_HMP_cultures_full_set	22	12	0.001420338733510107	0.6582042853488191	specs_ms.mgf	1

Gradient benchmarking dataset for ordination (QTOF only) Description: Generated by the Dorrestein lab, it consists of mixtures of 4 samples prepared at different sample ratios. Method: They were analysed on the Q-Exactive and the Maxis II (qTOF), in three chromatographic conditions (C18, C18RTshift, and C18polar). Material and methods. All solvents and reactants used were LC-MS grade. Samples. Four samples were used in the gradient benchmarking dataset: - The NIST 1950 SRM human serum sample. See the following manuscript for more informations (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/ac402503m) - Two human fecal samples collected from a male individual with a 35 days interval (Sample F1= 11-10-2013, and F2= 12-14-2013). Samples are part of the American Gut Project (https://msystems.asm.org/content/3/3/e00031-18) - A tomato seedling sample (Solanum lycopersicum) was prepared using 3 weeks post germination specimens (fresh whole seedling was used). Sample preparation. The NIST SRM 1950 sample (1mL), the two fecal samples (210 mg of fresh material each), and the tomato seedling (800 mg of fresh material) were dissolved in 1 mL of 70/30 MeOH/H2O, and homogenized in a tissue-lyser (QIAGEN) at 25 Hz for 5 min. The tubes were then centrifugated at 15,000 rpm for 15 min, and 600 uL of the supernatants was collected and load on SPE cartdriges (Oasis HLB, Hydrophilic-Lipophilic-Balance, 30 mg with particle sizes of 30 um), that were prealably activated with 100% MeOH, and 100% H2O. After loading the supernatants, 95/5 MeOH/H2O was used as wash solvent (1 mL), then the elution was carried with 70/30 MeOH/H2O (2mL), an 100% methanol (1mL). Dried extracts were resuspended in 2.5 mL of 70/30 MeOH/H2O containing 0.5 uM of amitriptiline as internal standard. These extracts were used to prepare various combination of sample ratios, such as for NIST 1950 SRM / Tomato: 100/0, 75/25, 50/50, 25/75, 0/100. See the metadata for more informations. LC-MS/MS. Samples were analyzed using ultra high performance liquid chromatography (Dionex) coupled to a QTOF (Maxis II Bruker daltonics). Each sample was analyzed in triplicate, and the injection sequence was randomised. The QC mix sample was used to optimise the LC-MS/MS parameters and was injected periodically throughout the sequence. No carry over was observed. Three different chromatographic conditions were used (named C18, C18RTshift and C18polar). Two chromatographic columns were used: the Phenomenex Kinetex C18 1.7 um (100A) 100 x 2.1 (for C18 and C18RTshift), and the Phenomenex Kinetex C18 polar 1.6 um (100A) 100 x 2.1 mm (for C18polar). Both columns were equipped with a C18 guard cartridge (Phenomenex).. The mobile phases consisted of A (100% H2O + 0.1% formic acid) and B (100% ACN + 0.1% fomic acid), and the flow rate was set to 0.5 uL/min throughout the experiment, and the column maintainted at 40C. The same chromatographic elution method was used for the C18 and C18 polar conditions: 0.00-0.25 min, 20% B; 0.25 - 4.00 min, 50% B; 4.00 - 15.00 min, 100% B; 15.00 -15.90 min, 100% B; 16.00 - 18.00 min, 20% B.

Several oral bacterial species were grown anaerobically and fed either glucose or lactate in SHI medium (for method see: Edlund et al., 2013, Edlund et al, 2015 - see http://www.microbiomejournal.com/content/pdf/2049-2618-1-25.pdf   &   http://www.nature.com/ismej/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ismej201572a.html). Biofilm samples for LCMS were collected at different time points from growth wells. After growth was established in SHI medium, biofilms were washed with minimal medium and supplemented with either glucose or lactate (Veillonella species) (see Edlund et al., 2013, Edlund et al., 2015). Samples were collected both after the initial biofilm establishment in SHI medium and after the addition of the supplemented cdm medium. According to gnps network analyses and data sorting exercises: 1) ~10% of this data is reproducible; 2) several of the present masses can also be detected both in SHI and cdm medium. mzXML files for media is not uploaded here (i.e. no media subtraction can be employed using these files only). 	continuous/clustered_data/MSV000079151_specs_ms.mgf	MSV000079151	mixed oral bacterial isolates	394824	GNPS LCMS data from oral isolates during in vitro metabolism of sugar and lactate	2	12	0.0015696612665010434	0.6390095770494739	specs_ms.mgf	1

Gradient benchmarking dataset (q=Orbitrap only) .Description: Generated by the Dorrestein lab, it consists of mixtures of 4 samples prepared at different sample ratios. Method: They were analysed on the Q-Exactive and the Maxis II (qTOF), in three chromatographic conditions (C18, C18RTshift, and C18polar).METHODMaterial and methods. All solvents and reactants used were LC-MS grade.Samples. Four samples were used in the gradient benchmarking dataset: - The NIST 1950 SRM human serum sample. See the following manuscript for more informations (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/ac402503m)- Two human fecal samples collected from a male individual with a 35 days interval (Sample F1= 11-10-2013, and F2= 12-14-2013). Samples are part of the American Gut Project (https://msystems.asm.org/content/3/3/e00031-18) - A tomato seedling sample (Solanum lycopersicum) was prepared using 3 weeks post germination specimens (fresh whole seedling was used).Sample preparation. The NIST SRM 1950 sample (1mL), the two fecal samples (210 mg of fresh material each), and the tomato seedling (800 mg of fresh material) were dissolved in 1 mL of 70/30 MeOH/H2O, and homogenized in a tissue-lyser (QIAGEN) at 25 Hz for 5 min. The tubes were then centrifugated at 15,000 rpm for 15 min, and 600 uL of the supernatants was collected and load on SPE cartdriges (Oasis HLB, Hydrophilic-Lipophilic-Balance, 30 mg with particle sizes of 30 um), that were prealably activated with 100% MeOH, and 100% H2O. After loading the supernatants, 95/5 MeOH/H2O was used as wash solvent (1 mL), then the elution was carried with 70/30 MeOH/H2O (2mL), an 100% methanol (1mL).  Dried extracts were resuspended in 2.5 mL of 70/30 MeOH/H2O containing 0.5 uM of amitriptiline as internal standard. These extracts were used to prepare various combination of sample ratios, such as for NIST 1950 SRM / Tomato: 100/0, 75/25, 50/50, 25/75, 0/100. See the metadata for more informations.LC-MS/MS. Samples were analyzed using ultra high performance liquid chromatography (Vanquish, Thermo Scientific) coupled to a quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q Exactive, Thermo Scientific). Each sample was analyzed in triplicate, and the injection sequence was randomised. The QC mix sample was used to optimise the LC-MS/MS parameters and was injected periodically throughout the sequence. No carry over was observed. Liquid chromatography. Three different chromatographic conditions were used (named C18, C18RTshift and C18polar). Two chromatographic columns were used: the Phenomenex Kinetex C18 1.7 um (100A) 100 x 2.1 (for C18 and C18RTshift), and the Phenomenex Kinetex C18 polar 1.6 um (100A)  100 x 2.1 mm (for C18polar). Both columns were equipped with a C18 guard cartridge (Phenomenex).. The mobile phases consisted of A (100% H2O + 0.1% formic acid) and B (100% ACN + 0.1% fomic acid), and the flow rate was set to 0.5 uL/min throughout the experiment, and the column maintainted at 40C. The same chromatographic elution method was used for the C18 and C18 polar conditions: 0.00-0.25 min, 20% B; 0.25 - 4.00 min, 50% B; 4.00 - 15.00 min, 100% B; 15.00 -15.90 min, 100% B; 16.00 - 18.00 min, 20% B. Mass Spectrometry. The quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q Exactive, Thermo Scientific) was fitted with an electrospray source (HESI-II) operating in positive ionisation mode. The source used the following parameters: spray voltage, +3500 V; heater temperature, 437.5°C; capillary temperature, 268.75°C; S-lens RF, 50 (arb. units); sheath gas flow rate, 52.5 (arb. units); and auxiliary gas flow rate, 13.75 (arb. units). The samples were acquired in non-targeted MS2 acquisition mode, with up to four MS2 scans of the most abundant ions per MS1 scan. The spectra were recorded from 0.48 to 17 min. The following parameters were used for full MS scan: resolution (35,000), Automatic Gain Control target (1.0 x 106), maximum injection time (125?ms), scan range (150-1500 m/z). For the data-dependent in MS2, the following parameters were used: resolution (17,500), AGC target (2.5 x 105), maximum injection time (125?ms), loop count (4), isolation window (1.5 m/z) fixed first mass (70 m/z). (70-1500 m/z) and up to four MS/MS scans of the most abundant ions per duty cycle. Higher-energy collision induced dissociation was performed with a normalized collision energy of 30 (20, 35, 50). The data-dependent settings were set as follow: minimum AGC (1.25x 104 [intensity threshold 1.0 x 105]), apex trigger 3 to 15 s, charge exclusion 3-8 and > 8, exclude isotopes (on), dynamic exclusion (14.0 s).	continuous/clustered_data/MSV000083306_specs_ms.mgf	MSV000083306	Homo sapiens (NCBITaxon:9606);Solanum lycopersicum (NCBITaxon:4081)	2628	GNPS - Gradient benchmark dataset for ordination methods (q-Orbitrap data only)	35	13	0.0005696612665246903	0.59154359317264	specs_ms.mgf	1

EMP500 - http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/emp500/ The Earth Microbiome Project is a systematic attempt to characterize global microbial taxonomic and functional diversity for the benefit of the planet and humankind. The Earth Microbiome Project (EMP) is a massively collaborative effort to characterize microbial life on this planet. We use DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry of crowd-sourced samples to understand patterns in microbial ecology across the biomes and habitats of our planet. The EMP is a comprehensive example of open science, leveraging a collaborative network of 500+ investigators, supporting pre-publication data sharing, and crowdsourcing data analysis to enable universal principles to be explored. The standardized collection, curation, and analysis are enabling a robust interpretation of ecological trends.ls for metagenomic sequencing and assembly, with the goal of applying this workflow to a range of environmental samples, combined with metabolomic profiling. Our goal was to assemble a set of ~500 fresh environmental samples across a range of habitats, with the help of the EMP network of collaborators. We are doing traditional EMP amplicon sequencing, metagenomic sequencing (with assembly-free and assembly-based analysis), and metabolomics on these 500 samples. A biobank of frozen aliquots of samples is being maintained at UCSD (soil samples at PNNL) for future methods testing and analysis.	continuous/clustered_data/MSV000083475_specs_ms.mgf	MSV000083475	environmental samples <Bacillariophyta> (NCBITaxon:33858)	178216	GNPS - Earth Microbiome Project - EMP500 - Metabolomics v2 - Q-Exactive	155	13	0.01643033873352806	0.5508066344095318	specs_ms.mgf	1

<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a plant defense response that provides long-lasting, broad-spectrum pathogen resistance to uninfected distal leaves following an initial localized infection. However, little information is available on the molecular biological basis of SAR especially in uninfected distal leaves. </p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> Here, we used two SAR-inducing pathogen to induce SAR in Arabidopsis, and a metabolomics approach based on ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and mass spectrometry (MS) technique was used to identify SAR-related metabolites in SAR-inducing pathogen infected local leaves and uninfected distal leaves. </p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Multiple statistical analyses were used to identify differentially expressed metabolites. The result showed that primary metabolism and secondary metabolism were significantly altered in local leaves and distal leaves, including phenolic compounds, amino acids, nucleotides, organic acids and many other metabolites.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> The content of amino acids and phenolic compounds increased in distal leaves, suggesting their contribution to the establishment of SAR in distal leaves. In addition, 2’-hydroxy-4, 4’, 6’-trimethoxychalcone, phenylalanine and p-coumaric acid were identified as potential components which may play important roles both in basic resistance and SAR. This study provided a reference for understanding metabolic mechanism associated with SAR in Arabidopsis, which will be useful for further investigation of the molecular basis of SAR.</p>	continuous/clustered_data/MSV000085657_specs_ms.mgf	MSV000085657	Arabidopsis thaliana|3702	971	MetaboLights MTBLS1550 - GNPS Metabolomics analysis identifies metabolites associated with systemic acquired resistance in Arabidopsis	6	12	0.000410338733502158	0.5145394150906645	specs_ms.mgf	1

The application of ketogenic diet (KD) (high fat/low carbohydrate/adequate protein) as an auxiliary cancer therapy is a field of growing attention. KD provides sufficient energy supply for healthy cells, while possibly impairing energy production in highly glycolytic tumor cells. Moreover, KD regulates insulin and tumor related growth factors (like insulin growth factor-1, IGF-1). In order to provide molecular evidence for the proposed additional inhibition of tumor growth when combining chemotherapy with KD, we applied untargeted quantitative metabolome analysis on a spontaneous breast cancer xenograft mouse model, using MDA-MB-468 cells. Healthy mice and mice bearing breast cancer xenografts and receiving cyclophosphamide chemotherapy were compared after treatment with control diet and KD. Metabolomic profiling was performed on plasma samples, applying high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Statistical analysis revealed metabolic fingerprints comprising numerous significantly regulated features in the group of mice bearing breast cancer. This fingerprint disappeared after treatment with KD, resulting in recovery to the metabolic status observed in healthy mice receiving control diet. Moreover, amino acid metabolism as well as fatty acid transport were found to be affected by both the tumor and the applied KD. Our results provide clear evidence of a significant molecular effect of adjuvant KD in the context of tumor growth inhibition and suggest additional mechanisms of tumor suppression beyond the proposed constrain in energy supply of tumor cells.	continuous/clustered_data/MSV000085879_specs_ms.mgf	MSV000085879	Mus musculus|10090	135762	MetaboLights MTBLS1066 - GNPS Untargeted Metabolomics Reveals Molecular Effects of Ketogenic Diet on Healthy and Tumor Xenograft Mouse Models.	6	10	0.0005696612665246903	0.5057564494726422	specs_ms.mgf	1
